    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This Return and Refund Policy stands as the solemn instrument delineating the procedural
        framework governing returns and refunds pertaining to the VIP subscription services
        proffered by 433Tips on the hallowed precincts of the 433Tips platform. By engaging with or
        embarking upon the patronage of the VIP subscription services, you forthrightly acknowledge
        and embrace the tenets enshrined within this Policy.

    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Subscription Services and No Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        The VIP subscription services provided on the Website encompass a curated selection of
        premium sports match predictions, analyses, and related content spanning a spectrum of
        sports, including but not limited to football, basketball, tennis, rugby, and equestrian
        activities. Upon successful subscription enrollment and payment, the Company does not
        entertain requests for refunds.
      </p>

    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Commitment to Quality</h2>
      <p>
        The Company is dedicated to delivering a premium experience to its esteemed subscribers. We
        meticulously curate, analyze, and offer predictions based on the latest information and
        sophisticated algorithms. Nevertheless, the inherent uncertainties and dynamic nature of
        sports events dictate that predictions are speculative in nature and subject to
        unpredictable outcomes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Cancellation of Subscription</h2>
      <p>
        Subscribers maintain the autonomy to cancel their VIP subscription at any time through their
        account settings on the Website. Upon cancellation, the subscription will remain active
        until the end of the current billing cycle. No pro-rata refunds will be issued for the
        remaining period of the billing cycle.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Technical Issues and Service Disruptions</h2>
      <p>
        In the event of technical issues or service disruptions that impede access to the VIP
        subscription content, the Company endeavors to address and rectify such instances promptly.
        However, these issues do not warrant or qualify for a refund, given the speculative and
        non-tangible nature of the VIP subscription services.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Modification of Subscription Offerings</h2>
      <p>
        The Company reserves the right to modify, enhance, or discontinue specific aspects of the
        VIP subscription offerings, including but not limited to content, features, and delivery
        mechanisms. Such modifications shall not entitle subscribers to refunds for subscription
        fees already paid.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="abt-p-in">
      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Any disputes or claims arising from or related to the VIP subscription services shall be
        subject to the arbitration and jurisdiction provisions outlined in the Terms of Use for the
        Website.
